{"title":"Interactive Music","number":["2713"],"instructors":"Yotam  Mann","description":"\n        \tThe idea of Interactive Music (empowering listeners/players to personalize, perform and explore composed music in greater depth) has been expanding in popularity in recent years with big name artists such as Brian Eno, Radiohead and Bjork taking advantage of the musical possibilities that interactive technologies afford. This is convergent with the democratization of music-making softwares and the rise of DJ'ing which has expanded the audience for interactive music to a growing group of people who don't see music as something to enjoy passively, but to actively participate in. Interactive music is not necessarily about generative music or audio synthesis (though it does includes these) but about realizing a musical idea as a collaboration between the composer and the listener. This course will guide students to make their own interactive music and musical projects while considering how interaction enriches and augments the experience of the music.\r\n\r\nThe course will be structured around 1 final assignment in which students create an interactive music project/performance. They will be encouraged to use Javascript, but ultimately, the language or platform is up to the students. The initial assignment will be a low-tech / no-tech interactive music project followed by intermediary assignment in which students explore methods and dimensions of musical interaction which they can build off of for their final assignment. Intermediate projects will also give students a chance to learn and apply the lessons on Javascript and the Web Audio API (specifically a framework called Tone.js).   \r\n\r\nPossible projects might include: adaptive-length songs, music-based games, reactive/responsive compositions, interactive performances, collaborative jamming platforms, and interactive music boxes.\r\n\r\nThe format of the course will balance discussion, instruction and jamming. Topics will include exploring the spectrum of interactive music from playback to full-fledged instruments as well as relevant artistic questions such as “how much control should composers give to their players/listeners”. Students will be exposed to prior-art interactives in contemporary music, game pieces, and video game music.  \r\n\r\nThe technical part of the course will focus on Javascript, Web Audio (an HTML5 specification for audio synthesis, processing and playback) and Tone.js. Javascript is well suited for the course both for its ease-of-use and its ability to create multiplayer, mobile, location-based and click-based applications, among many other possibilities. Additionally, the browser provides a built-in means of distributing musical works.\r\n\r\n\t  \t\t  \t\t  \t\t  \t\t  \t\t  \t\t  \t\t  \t\t","_id":"Fkw74gauNfVx12x7"}

{"title":"Recurring Concepts in Art","number":["2586"],"instructors":"Georgia  Krantz","description":"\n        \tAs a response to developing technologies, artists working in areas of new/digital media are continually inventing new concepts for self-expression - interactivity, the passage of time and resolution, just to name a few. Yet these concepts are new only in the sense that they are being adapted to new media. For example, the notion of interactivity, frequently observed as original and specific to the user-interaction component of computer-mediated works, was equally, if differently, specific to Gianlorenzo Bernini's 17th-century Baroque sculpture and architecture.  Indeed the very concept of new media, and the concomitant implication of critically significant artistic development, applies throughout history.  Oil revolutionized painting in the Renaissance, as did house-paint (on canvas) in the 1950s; in the 1910s, the found object indelibly altered definitions of art, the importance of the object being subsumed by that of the concept in the 1960s.  This course examines how artists working before the boom of digital technology utilized other media, techniques and approaches to effect formal, conceptual and experiential dynamics comparable to those being investigated by new media artists today. The objective of the course is to provide students with not only knowledge of the immensely rich history of artistic creativity, but also a platform through which that knowledge might be utilized to reconsider new media strategies of artistic expression. It is the goal that through observation, discussion, reading and projects (both written and hands-on), students acquire mental tools to approach their own work with an expanded understanding of artistic possibility.  Organized thematically, each class focuses on a different concept derived from the field of new media production and examined with regard to artistic precedents.  The course focus primarily, though not exclusively, is on 20th/21st-century art.  It is conducted as a combination lecture/discussion class.   Critical theory is incorporated into the readings and discussions, but this is not strictly a theory course.

Technology, specifically surveillance technology, now both powerful and ubiquitous is partially responsible.  We are surrounded by networked surveillance cameras, small or easily concealed recording devices are easily obtained, even our own mobile phones and desktop computers can be used to watch and track our behavior or even unwittingly capture our images.\r\n\r\nIn this course, along with students from Tisch’s Grad Film department, we’ll explore surveillance tools in the context of film production. Surveillance and the technology of surveillance will be explored as both the topic of films produced as well as the means of production.\r\n\r\nThis course will be co-taught by ITP faculty member Shawn Van Every and Carol Dysinger from Grad Film.  Enrollment will be limited to 8 students from each department working together in pairs or small teams. \r\n\r\nIt will run on a modified schedule at ITP for 12 weeks during the semester. Specifically, it will meet on weeks 1 through 9 and 12 through 14 with a “production break” during week’s 10 and 11.  (The “production break” is when the Grad Film students go into production on their directing class assignments and may be when the filming for this class will occur as well.)\r\n\t\t\t      Course Syllabus\n\t\t","_id":"1Yi4rDf0mHth4KHH"}
{"title":"Temporary Expert: Designing for Education","number":["2721"],"instructors":"Mimi  Yin","description":"\n        \tDesign practice for building education technology, K through Higher Ed.\r\n\r\nDoes education need technology? Can we apply learnings from web instrumentation and behavioral analytics to reimagine how we assess student AND teacher performance so that assessment is a natural byproduct of instruction, not a disruption of it? Can assessment itself become a form of instruction? How can we leverage technology to remodel the classroom along the lines of the modern workplace with its demands for collaboration, self-direction and the ability to tackle uncertainty with gusto! Who are the stakeholders in edtech? Who are the decision-makers? What are the challenges to adoption and perhaps more importantly sales? How do you test the efficacy of edtech? Is it even possible? These are just some of the questions we’ll tackle as a group.\r\n\r\nCourse content is organized along 2 parallel tracks: The first is topical and intended to build a broad-ranging knowledge of education from demographics and pedagogy to assessment and business models through collaborative research. The second is practical and meant to provide hands-on experience with an iterative approach to design from developing user scenarios to self-experimentation to rapid prototyping and testing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t  \t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t      Course Syllabus\n\t\t","_id":"DGXzJNUBkIVZiObb"}

Mycelial networks have been likened to social and communications networks. What do we have in common with mushrooms? What can we learn from them? Fungi communicate, remediate, and decompose. They are used as food, medicine, spiritual guides, and material building blocks. Some are crucial to the soil food web; others will kill you. Fungi are closer to Animalia than to Plantae, and only 5% of the Fungi have been classified. \r\n\r\nStudents will explore fungi through reading, writing and interacting with fungi, and making two projects that explore the physical and conceptual material covered in class. Readings that span the biological, theoretical, social and creative will include Paul Stamets, Dale Pendell, Anna Tsing, and Gilles Deleuze.

Anais Nin\r\nThe relation between what we see and what we know is never settled.  John Berger\r\nI paint objects as I think them, not as I see them.  Pablo Picasso\r\n\r\nThis course comprises a re-envisioning of a decade of work at museums teaching people who are blind or have low vision about 20th-century art.  We will focus not on people’s lack of sight, but rather the different kinds of sight they bring to art objects, and explore these ways of seeing as contextualized through diverse literature and applied to our own individual practices. \r\n\r\nIn the above quotes, Anais Nin considers subjective vision, John Berger the profoundly complex relationship between seeing and knowing, and Pablo Picasso the non-privileging of sight as the primary mechanism for making and creativity. In the natural sciences, looking may be observed as the process of light passing through the eye, as distinct from seeing, which refers to the brain's processing of information; whereas fields of psychology and philosophy approach perception in relation to subjectivity, reality, knowledge and experience.  Artists and thinkers in areas of cultural studies have considered sight and perception in relation to identity, gender, race, power, history and a host of other social structures. \r\n\r\nThroughout the semester, students will have the opportunity to work directly with artists and art appreciators with visual impairments to gain feedback and critique as they develop their own work.

{"title":"Understanding Networks","number":["2808"],"instructors":"Thomas  Igoe","description":"\n        \tInteractive technologies seldom stand alone. They exist in networks, and they facilitate networked connections between people.  Designing technologies for communications requires an  understanding of networks. This course is a foundation in how  networks work. Through weekly readings and class discussions and  a series of short hands-on projects, students gain an  understanding of network topologies, how the elements of a  network are connected and addressed, what protocols hold them  together, and what dynamics arise in networked environments.    This class is intended to supplement the many network-centric  classes at ITP.  It is broad survey, both of contemporary  thinking about networks, and of current technologies and methods  used in creating them.  Prerequisites: Students should have an understanding of basic  programming (Intro to Computational Media or equivalent).   Familiarity with physical computing (Intro to Physical Computing  or equivalent) is helpful, but not essential. Some, though not  all, production work in the class requires programming and  possibly physical and electronic construction. There is a significant reading component to this class as well.\r\n\r\nPossible topics include:\r\n\r\n* topologies: how to think about them (nodes and links), how few  workable ones there are, and how there's no topology so stupid it  isn't in use some place.\r\n* addressing and routing: what a namespace is, three ways to  generate a name (nesting, serial uniqueness, random pseudo- uniqueness), the difference between smart and dumb networks, why  the phone network and the internet differ even though they use  the same wires\r\n* protocols: envelopes and contents, the stack and the reference  lie, end-to-end principles, reliability vs. speed tradeoffs\r\n* scale: more is different, scale breaks otherwise workable  systems, makes redundancy and degeneracy critical, tends to push  systems\r\n* a discussion of security and its effects\r\n\r\nPossible exercises include:\r\n* Basic socket communication, both software and embedded hardware  versions\r\n* Client-server programming\r\n* A group protocol/messaging exercise\r\n* An HTTP/RESTian model exercise \t\t  \t\t  \t\t  \t\t  \t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t      Course Syllabus\n\t\t","_id":"YfoTzByg2WfRUCLc"}
